# POKER PLANNER

Poker planner is an application that provides a powerful and fun way to improve planning and estimation ceremonies for remote and in-person teams. Instantly import stories from your favorite project management platform like Jira. Discuss the scope and effort of each story as a team, then compare everyone’s anonymous estimate. If the team doesn’t come to a consensus, have a discussion to better understand the work, then estimate again until the team reaches an agreement. When you’re done, simply export your estimates and notes back to your favorite project management tool. 

## Base setup with react ts
